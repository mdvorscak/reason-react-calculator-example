# reason-react-calculator example

This is just a simple calculator 'App' which I created to begin learning [Reason React](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react)

## Interact

[Interact with the project live here](http://reason-react-calculator-example.surge.sh/)

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
# in another tab, note: you must run both start and server
npm run server
```

Then view in the browser at http://localhost:8000. Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh.
